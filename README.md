# Infinimix
A small project that's meant to essentially be a clone of the [Eternal Jukebox][eternal_jukebox].

The idea is that you take a song (either uploaded or off of youtube--I'm speaking practicality here) and find the parts
of the song that are similar, then when hitting those similar parts, randomly jump between the similar parts. This,
with strategic "randomness," creates infinite--or just simply really long--songs.

Another idea is to extend the functionality to jump between two songs, wherever they're similar, but I'll that's for the
future currently.
